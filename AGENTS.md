## Architecture rules
- Data lives in the user's own Supabase project as one `docs(collection,id,data jsonb)` table accessed only by the server via `TIGORIX_DB_SECRET_KEY` (src/lib/fsdb.server.ts) — keeps the old collection/id API and gives browsers zero DB access.
- All balance changes go through the `ledger_credit` SQL function (balance + transaction in one atomic step) — makes the ledger audit exact and blocks negative balances.
- Every reward/withdraw server function runs through `act()` (per-user lock + fresh reload + ledger audit) and one-time claims use `createDoc` atomic inserts — prevents parallel double-claims.
- Schema changes are shipped as `supabase/schema.sql` for the user to paste into their SQL editor — the project is not linked to Lovable's Supabase connector.
- Collection reads page through the database 1000 rows at a time (`queryDocs`/`allDocs` in fsdb.server.ts) — the database caps each request at 1000 rows.
- Broadcasts are sent in 100-user chunks driven by the admin panel (`offset` → `next`) — keeps each server call short and under Telegram's 30 msg/sec limit.
